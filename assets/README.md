Place your logo file here with the name: **Logo.png**

### Requirements:
- File name: `Logo.png` (exact case)
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or higher
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- The logo will be used in the app as the main heart logo

### Usage:
Once you place Logo.png in this folder, the app will automatically use it as the main logo instead of the emoji heart.

└── README.md         (This file)
```
